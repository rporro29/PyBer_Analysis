# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Analysis
For this week's challenge, we were asked to create a DataFrame. Using the data from the DataFrame, I see that Pyber operates in different types of cities. Such as Urban, Suburban, and Rural. I was also tasked to create a multiple-line chart based on the information I gathered. 

## Results
Using the Dataframe, I gathered the following Results.
Please take a look at the picture below.

The Rural areas had the highest average fare per ride and also the highest average fare per driver. Because there are fewer drivers in those areas, there are 78 drivers. 

The Suburban areas had an average fare per ride of $30.97 and an average fare per driver of 39.50. There is a total of 490 drivers in this area, with a total of 625 rides. 

The urban area has the most drivers at 2,405. But at the same time, it has the lowest average fare per ride, and driver at $24.53 and 16.57, respectively.

## Summary
Looking at our line chart, we can see the months where the fare price increased and decreased. The company should research what is causing these changes a plan accordingly.

The company should offer drivers incentives to drive in the rural area, which could help balance the supply and demand going in that area. 

Lastly, the company should research effective ways to market itself in rural areas. Since there were only 125 rides in that area. This could be done by making Pybar attractive to people living in rural areas.
